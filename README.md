## Supported Models

| Model | Best for | Language support | Download size | Hardware |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nemotron Speech 3.5 - Ultra Fast Low Latency | Streaming-capable multilingual dictation | Around 40 languages | ~670 MB | Apple Silicon |
| Nemotron 3.5 Multilingual | Slower but more accurate multilingual dictation | Around 40 languages | ~530 MB | Apple Silicon |
| [Parakeet Flash (Beta)](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet_realtime_eou_120m-v1) | Lowest-latency live English dictation | English only | ~250 MB | Apple Silicon |
| Parakeet TDT v3 | Fast default multilingual dictation | [25 languages](#parakeet-tdt-v3-languages) | ~500 MB | Apple Silicon |
| Parakeet TDT v2 | Fastest English-only dictation | [English only](#parakeet-tdt-v2-languages) | ~500 MB | Apple Silicon |
| Cohere Transcribe | High-accuracy multilingual dictation | [14 languages](#cohere-transcribe-languages) | ~1.4 GB | Apple Silicon |
| Apple Speech | Zero-download native macOS speech recognition | [System languages](#apple-speech-languages) | Built-in | Apple Silicon + Intel |

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/altic-dev/FluidVoice.git
cd FluidVoice
open Fluid.xcodeproj
```

Build and run in Xcode. All dependencies are managed via Swift Package Manager.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please create an issue first to discuss any major changes or feature requests before submitting a pull request.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/altic-dev/FluidVoice.git
   cd FluidVoice
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode:**
   ```bash
   open Fluid.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Run from Xcode (one-time signing setup):**
   - Target: `FluidVoice` → `Signing & Capabilities`
   - Enable `Automatically manage signing`
   - Pick your `Team` (Personal Team is fine)
   - This is stored in `xcuserdata/` (gitignored), so it won’t affect your PR

4. **Build and run** - All dependencies are managed via Swift Package Manager

5. **Build only (no signing):**
   ```bash
   xcodebuild -project Fluid.xcodeproj -scheme Fluid -destination 'platform=macOS' build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
   ```

5. **(Optional) Install pre-commit hook** to prevent accidental team ID commits:
   ```bash
   cp scripts/check-team-id.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Keep changes focused and atomic** - one feature or fix per PR
- **Create an issue before raising a PR** so the work is easy to track and validate before review starts
- **Discuss before raising a PR** for anything non-trivial so it is easier to merge and review tradeoffs up front
- **Explain the pros and cons** of your approach when discussing larger changes
- **Follow the PR template** when opening your pull request
- **Update documentation** if adding new features
- **Test thoroughly** on your machine before submitting
- **Never commit personal team IDs or API keys** to `project.pbxproj`
- **Check git diff** before committing to ensure no personal settings leaked in

## Connect

Follow development updates on X: [@ALTIC_DEV](https://x.com/ALTIC_DEV)

## Run integration dictation test

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Fluid.xcodeproj -scheme Fluid -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

If you run into a test bundle load error related to code signing/Team ID, run without overriding code signing flags (the command above), or explicitly:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Fluid.xcodeproj -scheme Fluid -destination 'platform=macOS' CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Automatic
```

CI uses unsigned builds:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project Fluid.xcodeproj -scheme Fluid -destination 'platform=macOS' CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

## Privacy & Analytics

FluidVoice is designed to be local-first, but it includes optional anonymous analytics, solely to keep track of FV usage and future feature development.

### What this helps with
- Feature usage patterns (for example dictation, command mode, and write mode)
- Product reliability and performance tuning
- Anonymous release health signals to prioritize fixes and improvements

### What is collected
- App version, build, and macOS version
- Low-cardinality feature/config flags (for example app mode and major settings)
- Approximate usage ranges (not exact values)
- High-level success/error outcomes

### What is not collected
- Your voice, Raw audio or transcribed text
- Selected text, prompts, or AI-generated responses
- Terminal commands or outputs
- Window titles, file names/paths, clipboard content, or typed content
- or ANYTHING personal or private information. 

### How to disable
Analytics are enabled by default. You can disable or re-enable them at any time from:

`Settings → Share Anonymous Analytics`

### Why this exists
Anonymous telemetry helps us understand what breaks, where performance can be improved, and which features matter most without collecting personal content.
This helps us continue building what users want and if we should even continue developing features for you.
